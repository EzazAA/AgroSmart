# AgroSmart
**Intro** - This is a full fledged AgriTech project That is currently being opensourced. This is still in `Beta` , It consists of a Device that detects soil moisture , Light intensity Humidity and temperature and send it to a mobile app. Then according to the water level the pump is being automatically operated. There is also and ai feature called Disease prediction which does disease prediction of crops on the basis of predefined smtopns as the name suggests. Currently this model is being improved and open-sourced on huggingface (link will be available soon).
